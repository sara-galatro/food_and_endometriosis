# The relation between food and endometriosis: building a recommendation system prototype

Endometriosis is a chronic illness which deeply affects the lives of the people diagnosed with it, both physically and psychologically.To this day, no cure has been found. 
One of the main therapies suggested is linked to specific diet guidelines based on chemical and biological analysis of foods. However, many patients signal how these diets do not work and,in somecases, even worsen their symptoms.
Therefore, we propose to shift the focus from the eats to the people and to analyze their characteristics and reactions to what they eat to create an auxiliary system that will help more patients create a new balanced lifestyle with endometriosis.

The data were collected through a Google Form shared on social media. The methods used are **normalized K-Nearest Neighbour** and **Singular Vector Decomposition** with various metrics.

This repository contains the code and the original presentation on the building a prototype for a recommendation system in which the users are patients suffering from endometriosis and the objects are food. Both are in Italian and were created between December 2022 and February 2023 for the course "IN550 - Machine Learning" at the Department of Mathematics and Physics of Roma Tre University. There is also a short presentation (dated April 2024) in English.
